# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

BlueSky Store Locator & Management System - A comprehensive web application for managing malls and stores in Doha, Qatar, featuring role-based authentication, interactive maps, and CRUD operations based on user permissions.

**Current Status**: Phase 3 Interactive Map Integration Complete (100%) - Ready for Phase 4: Data Display Components

## Development Environment

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Server management (primary development focus)
npm run start:server          # Start unified server (production mode)
npm run dev:server           # Development mode with hot reload on port 5001

# Project setup
npm run install:all          # Install dependencies across all workspaces
npm run clean               # Clean all node_modules

# Data management  
npm run validate-data       # Validate mall and store data integrity

# Development utilities (when client is implemented)
npm run dev:client          # Start React/Vite dev server (port 5173)
npm run build:client        # Build client for production
npm run test:client         # Run Vitest tests
npm run lint:client         # Run ESLint on client code
npm run typecheck:client    # TypeScript strict mode validation
```

## Architecture Overview

### Monorepo Structure

**Workspace Organization:**
- `/client/` - React frontend (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind) - Foundation setup complete
- `/server/` - Unified Express backend (JWT auth + file-based storage) - Complete
  - `index.js` - Main unified API server combining auth and data endpoints
  - `data/malls.json` - Mall and store data with Doha coordinates
  - `utils/` - Server utilities (validate-data.js, spatial-utils.ts)
- `/docs/` - Project documentation (PRD.md, initial-requirements.md)
- `docs/TODOS.md` - Comprehensive task tracking for all development phases
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Project change history and version tracking

### Backend Architecture

**Authentication System (COMPLETE):**
- JWT-based with 3 roles: `admin`, `manager`, `store`
- Demo credentials: admin/a, manager/m, store/s
- 2-hour token expiration with proper validation
- Role-based middleware protecting all API endpoints

**API Endpoints & Permissions (COMPLETE):**
- `POST /api/login` - User authentication (returns JWT)
- `GET /api/malls` - Fetch mall/store data (authenticated users)
- `PATCH /api/malls/:id/toggle` - Toggle mall open/close (admin only)
- `PATCH /api/malls/:mallId/stores/:storeId/toggle` - Toggle store status (manager only)
- `PUT /api/malls/:mallId/stores/:storeId` - Update store details (store role only)
- `GET /api/health` - Server health check and status
- `GET /api/stores` - Mock endpoint for testing purposes

**Data Storage (COMPLETE):**
- In-memory with file persistence (`server/data/malls.json`)
- Atomic writes with error handling using `fs.writeFileSync`
- Cascading operations: Mall closure/opening affects all nested stores
- Data validation utilities ensure geographic coordinate integrity

### Frontend Architecture (Foundation Ready)

**Tech Stack (COMPLETE):**
- React 18 + TypeScript (strict mode) âœ…
- Vite for build tooling with HMR âœ…
- Tailwind CSS for modern styling âœ…
- ESLint + Prettier + strict TypeScript âœ…
- Vitest for testing framework âœ…
- React Router v6 for navigation âœ…
- Leaflet for interactive maps âœ…
- React Hook Form + form validation âœ…
- Axios HTTP client with interceptors âœ…
- React Context for auth state management âœ…

**Planned Key Patterns (Phase 2+):**
- Role-based UI rendering (hide/disable features by user role)
- Protected routes with authentication guards
- Optimistic updates with rollback on API failure
- Map-centered design (full-screen with overlays)
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Geographic Data Management

**Coordinate System:**
- Qatar-specific validation (lat: 24.5-26.0, lon: 50.5-52.0)
- Doha center: 25.2854Â° N, 51.5310Â° E
- Haversine formula for distance calculations in `spatial-utils.ts`

**Data Validation:**
- Required fields: name, coordinates, opening_hours
- Duplicate ID detection
- Swapped lat/lng detection
- Run `npm run validate-data` before data changes

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Permission Matrix:**
- **Admin**: Toggle entire malls (cascades to all stores)
- **Manager**: Toggle individual stores (cannot open if mall closed)
- **Store**: Edit store details (name, hours, description)

**Implementation:**
- Backend: JWT middleware validates role for each endpoint
- Frontend: Conditional rendering based on user.role
- Cascading logic: Mall status overrides store status

  longitude: number;
  isOpen: boolean;
  stores: Store[];
}

interface Store {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  type: string;
  isOpen: boolean;
  opening_hours: string;
}
```

**Authentication:**
```typescript
interface User {
  username: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'manager' | 'store';
}
```

## Important Implementation Notes

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Port Configuration**: Server on 5001 (avoiding macOS AirPlay conflict with 5000)
- **Map Library**: Leaflet planned over Cesium for simplicity and faster implementation
- **State Management**: React Context preferred over Redux for this project scope
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid "2030-era" modern design
- **Authentication**: JWT-based demo system suitable for assessment context
- **Data Persistence**: File-based JSON storage; easily replaceable with database
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications planned for user feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly controls

### Development Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enforced across all code
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with zero warnings policy
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for utilities and spatial calculations
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: MANDATORY for all new features and components
- **Documentation**: Transparent AI-assisted development approach
- **Git Workflow**: Feature branches with descriptive commit messages

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Requirements
**MANDATORY RULE**: All new features, components, and functionality MUST follow TDD approach:

1. **Write Tests First**: Before implementing any new feature or component:
   - Write failing tests that describe the expected behavior
   - Define test cases for happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios
   - Use Vitest for React components and utility functions
   - Create comprehensive test suites for API endpoints

2. **Implementation Cycle**:
   - ðŸ”´ **Red**: Write a failing test
   - ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
   - ðŸ”„ **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests passing
   - Repeat for each piece of functionality

3. **Test Coverage Requirements**:
   - **Components**: Test rendering, user interactions, props, and state changes
   - **Hooks**: Test all return values, side effects, and edge cases
   - **API Services**: Test all endpoints, error handling, and response parsing
   - **Utilities**: Test all functions with various inputs and edge cases
   - **Integration**: Test authentication flows, protected routes, and role-based access

4. **Testing Tools & Patterns**:
   - **Vitest** for unit and integration tests
   - **React Testing Library** for component testing
   - **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for API mocking
   - **User-centric testing** focusing on behavior over implementation
   - **Accessibility testing** with screen readers and keyboard navigation

5. **Test Organization**:
   - Co-locate tests with components: `Component.test.tsx`
   - Separate test utilities in `src/test/` directory
   - Mock external dependencies and API calls
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior

6. **Before Any PR**:
   - All tests must pass: `npm run test:client`
   - Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
   - Include tests for new functionality in commit messages
   - Review tests as part of code review process

**Example TDD Workflow for New Feature**:
```bash
# 1. Write failing test
touch src/components/NewFeature.test.tsx
# Write test cases for expected behavior

# 2. Run tests (should fail)
npm run test:client

# 3. Implement minimal code to pass tests
touch src/components/NewFeature.tsx
# Write just enough code to make tests pass

# 4. Refactor and improve while tests stay green
# 5. Add more test cases and repeat cycle
```

This TDD approach ensures:
- **Higher code quality** with fewer bugs
- **Better design** through test-first thinking
- **Confidence in refactoring** with comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation** through test cases that explain expected behavior
- **Faster debugging** when tests pinpoint exact failures
